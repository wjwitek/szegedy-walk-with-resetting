## Szegedy walk with resetting 

This library is an implementation of Szegedy algorithm. It consists of three parts:
- **lib** - contains Szegedy class that can be used to create the evolution operator
- **utils** - functions for generating graphs and performing walks
- **experiments** - jupyter notebooks containing experiments performed as part of my thesis
